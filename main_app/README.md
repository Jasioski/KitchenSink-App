App.vue file contains the structure of the application and what will be displayed at all times. 

The components folder houses components used for the d3 animations as well as the home page of the application. 

The data folder holds sample data used throughout the application as well as an interactive map of the United States.

The views folder holds files used when navigating through different pages of the Application by modifying the URL.
